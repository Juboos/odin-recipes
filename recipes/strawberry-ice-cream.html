  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Homemade strawberry ice cream with sweet, juicy strawberries! Some people consider this quick strawberry ice cream recipe a hack because we're skipping the more time-consuming egg-custard step; but even if I didn't want to save time I'd still prefer this method for strawberry ice cream.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingredient</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>12 ounces fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
    <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
    <li>2 drops red food coloring (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place strawberries and sugar in a blender and pulse until pureed; set aside to steep for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour cream, milk, vanilla extract, and salt into strawberry mixture; blend until smooth and slightly thickened, 10 to 15 seconds. Whisk red food color into cream mixture.</li>
    <li>Pour strawberry mixture into the container of an ice cream maker and process until thick according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
    <li>Transfer ice cream to a sealable container, cover the ice cream with plastic wrap, seal the container, and freeze, 2 hours to overnight.</li>
  </ol>
